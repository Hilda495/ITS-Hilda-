<h1><b>HEY GUYZZ!</b></h1>
<p><h2><b>WELCOME TO MY BLOG PAGE..</b></h2></p>
<p>You know what?.. <b>"No man is an island here"..</b> Why did they even say this on that time..? Because somebody would think the same of them? Nah.. Its different. Man atleast would think of an island in the midst of the sea when he's alone. To create empathy with himself. None would agree with this. But that's how I've been all my life. No island is a man.</p> 
<p> AWW.. That's a pessimistic intro. But still someone would go to my heart? Nah. I'll just be fine without anybody but god who loves me. Yeah?</p>
<h2><b><u>How to lead a peaceful life?</u></b></h2>
<p>For many people <i>peaceful</i> life will remain a question. Unless and until they break their <i>comfort zone</i> and foresee their ample needs. At the same instant, life isn't a <i>horse league</i>. Humans have the most magnificent feature to feel and relish evrything that God has created. They <i>laugh,</i> they <i>cry</i>. No animal can do that. However nowadays, humans have found it more fashionable to be <i>stoic</i>. <b>Emotionless.</b> So why do we have to be humans for that? Emotions are priceless when they are exerted at the right moment and to right person.</p> <p>So how do we choose the <i>right person?</i> No one can choose the right person just by <i>superficial gaze.</i> Everybody has flaws and everybody has strengths. No one would want to be bullied for their flaws and no one would want to be alienated for them. We all make mistakes and we love to hate each other being in our own <i>small dark world..</i> This certainly would deny <i>peace</i> by itself. Everyone l                          ongs to get treated better even when they know they're <b>impossible</b> sometimes. So why isn't it possible for them to bear with their fellow chums?</p> <p>Life is good when one loves oneself unconditionally and does the same to his fellow pals. That's not too far. Just don't destruct yourself by lurking in your <b>dark past.</b> If you find flaws in your present, try to combat with it and amend it. You still aren't far away from it. <em>Unmask</em> yourself so that you wouldn't be having a hard time playing along with your <b>incognito self.</b> Longing for more will cause territory crumble to ruins. <i>Burry your past.. Embrace your peace in the present.. But don't be idle for the future.</i> Just relish life for the way it leaves you in awe <i>everyday, every moment.</i></p>
